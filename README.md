# Aikido Thesaurus
Unhappy with all the others on the internet, so decided to make my own.  
If you remember a term used in class and can't find a definition, just add it to a category with no definition so that somebody can answer it later.  
Please keep the format. If you are unfamiliar with github flavored markdown, just make sure that your entry looks like this, before submitting:
``` 
* **term** - definition
```
Please add your wisdom with a pull-request, sensei!
